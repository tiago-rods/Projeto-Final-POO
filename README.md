🃏 PvP Card Game — README
🚀 How to Run the Project
Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
Open the project in your preferred IDE (we used Intellij)

To verify that the Java module is in the correct path: Go to File → Project Structure (Ctrl + Alt + Shift + S). In the left menu, go to Modules Click on + → New Module Choose Java In the folder field, select the project directory (InscryptionPvP). Click Finish.

In IntelliJ:
Right-click on the "src" folder → Select Mark Directory as → Sources Root.
Right-click on the "resources" folder → Select Mark Directory as → Resources Root.

We used JavaFX to run UI, so you have to add "lib" folder of JavaFX: Go to File → Project Structure → Libraries → "+" button → select Java → Search for local where you installed JavaFX (i.e: D:\JavaFX\javafx-sdk-25.0.1\lib)

run -> edit configurations -> add new configuration -> application -> modify options -> add VM options
add: --module-path "PATH_HERE" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml
The path is the JavaFX lib folder.

Compile and run the main game class

📌 Overview
This project is a PvP (Player vs Player) card game inspired by classic turn-based strategy games, with strong emphasis on sacrifice mechanics, resource management, and tactical board positioning.

The game was developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Event-Oriented Programming (EOP) concepts, ensuring a modular, organized, and easily maintainable architecture.

The main goal is to deliver an intense and strategic competitive experience between two players.

🎮 Game Features
Local PvP gameplay (player versus player)
4x4 board, optimized for strategic matches
Card system with multiple cost types (blood, bones, and zero cost)
Core mechanics including sacrifice, items, sigils, and damage scale
Dark thematic and atmospheric style
Turn-based gameplay
🧠 Core Mechanics
🃴 Cards
The game features different card types:

No-cost cards: mainly used as resources (e.g., squirrels)
Blood-cost cards: require sacrifices to be played
Bone-cost cards: require a specific amount of accumulated bones
🩸 Sacrifice System
To play blood-cost cards, players must sacrifice other cards. Most cards grant 1 sacrifice point, except those with special sigils that increase this value.

🦴 Bones
Whenever a card is destroyed or sacrificed, the player gains bones, which act as an alternative resource for summoning certain cards.

✨ Sigils
Sigils are special abilities attached to cards, enabling unique actions such as:

Multi-directional attacks
Special movement
Flight
Unique board interactions
🎒 Items
Items are powerful tools capable of drastically changing the outcome of a match. They can be obtained in three ways:

Random starting item
Through cards with specific sigils
When a player reaches 1 remaining life
⚔️ Combat and Board
Cards are first placed on a placement tile
After one round, they automatically move to the attack tile
If no opposing card is present, damage is dealt directly to the opponent
⚖️ Damage Scale System
Each player has a damage scale:

When it reaches 5 weights against the player, they lose 1 life
Each player starts with 2 lives
🏗️ Project Architecture
📦 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
OOP is used to model the main game entities, such as:

Cards (base classes and specializations)
Players
Decks
Board
Items and Sigils
Applied principles include:

Encapsulation
Inheritance
Polymorphism
Single Responsibility Principle
⚡ Event-Oriented Programming (EOP)
Game logic is heavily driven by events, including:

Playing a card
Sacrificing a card
Turn start and end
Sigil activation
Item usage
Combat resolution
This approach allows new mechanics to be added with minimal impact on existing code.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Language: Java (adjust if necessary)
Paradigms: OOP and EOP
Graphical Interface: JavaFX (if applicable)
